# AutoScrabble
Java program where you enter the current board and your tiles, and it finds the highest scoring word.

I originally wrote this in high school, but have revisited it and made some improvements.

### Instructions
- Click on the board or rack to select tiles
- Move around with arrow keys
- Type a letter to place a tile in the selected location (backspace removes one)
- On the rack, type a space to place a blank
- On the board, right click a tile to change it to a blank
- Press enter to search for a word
